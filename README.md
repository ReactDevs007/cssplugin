### Purpose

There are [over a hundred wonderful developers](https://github.com/himynameisdave/postcss-plugins/blob/master/docs/authors.md) building amazing PostCSS plugins. The running list of plugins grows quickly, and is used in many places, such on the [PostCSS readme](https://github.com/postcss/postcss#plugins) and on the searchable [postcss.parts](http://postcss.parts) built by [**@mxstbr**](https://github.com/mxstbr). These are great resources for developers to find plugins, but they can sometimes be out of sync/incomplete.

The purpose of this is to be as clear and concise as possible, and provide a consolidated package for developers who need an up-to-date list of PostCSS plugins.

### Install

```
npm i postcss-plugins
```

### Usage

```javascript

var plugins = require('postcss-plugins');

//  Sample usage: print the name of every plugin in the dataset
plugins.forEach( function( plugin ){
  console.log(plugin.name);
});

```

### Submiting A Plugin

All plugins are welcome, so long as they meet the [PostCSS Plugin Guidelines](https://github.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/docs/guidelines/plugin.md) (yes you will write some tests, and yes, you will like it :smile:).
