### Plugin Tags List

I am maintaining a list of tags so that things remain sane:

 **Tag Name**  | **Tag Description**
 --------------|--------------------
**`color`**         | does something with colors
**`debug`**         | does something like linting/validating/debugging
**`extensions`**    | does something that extends the language
**`fallbacks`**     | does something about adding fallbacks for older browsers
**`font`**          | does something involving fonts
**`future`**        | does something to make CSS more future-ready
**`media-queries`** | does something with media queries
**`pack`**          | does a series of somethings, like rucksack
**`sass`**          | does something sassy
**`svg`**           | does something involving SVG

#### Some notes:

- No need for hash symbols (eg: `#color`)
- No need for **`postcss-*`** as a tag ([we get it](http://i.imgur.com/uh6U3em.jpg))
- No need for adding every single tag if they don't actually apply to your plugin, try to keep it under 5
