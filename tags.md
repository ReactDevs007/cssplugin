### Plugin Tags List

I am maintaining a list of tags so that things remain sane:

 **Tag Name**  | **Tag Description**
 --------------|--------------------
**`pack`**    | for a package of PostCSS plugins (like rucksack)
**`future`**  | involves some use of future-ready css
**`color`**   | does something with colors
**`media-queries`** | does something with media queries
**`sass`**    | involves some sort of Sassy feature
**`debug`**   | does some sort of linting/validating/debugging
**`font`**    | something involving fonts
**`svg`**     | something involving SVG

#### Some notes:

- No need for hash symbols (eg: `#color`)
- No need for **`postcss-*`** as a tag ([we get it](http://i.imgur.com/uh6U3em.jpg))
- No need for adding every single tag if they don't actually apply to your plugin, try to keep it under 5
